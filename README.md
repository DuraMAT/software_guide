#  Guidelines for the open-source software development


## Purposes
To help you share software products effectively, including:

- Sharing best practices in software dissemination

- Save time and effort in the dissemination process

- Establishing some consistency across projects

- Getting you (and DuraMat) more credit for software products


## Overview of dissemination levels
The level of dissemination should depend on the purpose of the software
